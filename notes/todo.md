- if `send_signal` raises, error the run
- improve `apsis job` output style


# Cleanup

Clean up the classic agents.  If ephemeral agents are required, use Procstar
(started over SSH?) for this.


### Database schema

- Remove `message` from run JSON and `runs` table.

- Move metadata out of `runs` into its own table, along with any other column
  that isn't part of the run summary.

- Clean up `rerun` column as well.

- Rename `run_history` to `run_log`.

### Other

- To finish `check-job`, we need to remove the program, schedule, action, cond
  aliases from `config.yaml` and move them to a config file specific to the job
  dir.

- Factor loop watchers (`log.critical`) into a common pattern.

- Clean up the restore task.


# Idle thoughts

Change scheduler, scheduled, wait loops into async iters that return
instructions to Apsis, who then applies them, rather than applying them directly.


# Redis

- refactor on master:
  - split out run ID allocator
  - configure Redis instance in config.yaml
  - add a `RedisRunStore` and populate it from `RunStore.add` / `.remove`
  - add async `query()` and `subscribe()` methods
