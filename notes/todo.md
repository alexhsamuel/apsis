# Cleanup

### Schema

- Remove `message` from run JSON and `runs` table.

- Move metadata out of `runs` into its own table, along with any other column
  that isn't part of the run summary.

- Clean up `rerun` column as well.

- Rename `run_history` to `run_log`.

### Other

- To finish `check-job`, we need to remove the program, schedule, action, cond
  aliases from `config.yaml` and move them to a config file specific to the job
  dir.

- Factor loop watchers (`log.critical`) into a common pattern.

- Clean up the restore task.


# Idle thoughts

Change scheduler, scheduled, wait loops into async iters that return
instructions to Apsis, who then applies them, rather than applying them directly.


# Tools

- https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html for console output
- https://github.com/wildfoundry/dataplicity-lomond for websockets


# Redis

- refactor on master:
  - split out run ID allocator
  - configure Redis instance in config.yaml
  - add a `RedisRunStore` and populate it from `RunStore.add` / `.remove`
  - add async `query()` and `subscribe()` methods


# Docs

- schedule config
- actions

- web UI


# Current

- #165: conditional skip runs, e.g. skip if running
- #164, #152: limit duration of run in waiting state
- #156: auto-archive old runs

- in ora, truncate 0s from `Time.__str__` and `Daytime.__str__`

- support configured extension symbols in `template_expand`

- "wait" functionality in CLUI
  - `apsis wait r12345`

# Old

- Make RunsSocket replace runs, not stack them.
- Replace RunsSocket with a single ws pubsub protocol.

- API for submitting ad-hoc jobs.
- Hot reload jobs via API.

- When jobs changed, reschedule the docket job.
- When is the job fixed for an inst/run?  At start time?
  - Store job_id instead of job, until that time.

- Round all schedule times to some sane precision?
- Compute elapsed time in UI.

- Figure out how to handle errors in fetch(), or use something better.
- Webpack setup for web GUI.
- Incremental search on job view.
- Show when websocket disconnects.
- Handle exceptions in API.
- Handle API errors in UI.
- Validate jobs after loading.
- Validation of schedule, results.
- Show API JSON in UI.

- Clean up old files in repo.

- New session / pgroup / ?? for ProcessProgram.
- Add env, cwd, and other stuff to ProcessProgram.
- SSH wrapper.


cron
- format time with tz
- control precision in time, daytime formats
- parse weekdays (see repo.py)
- load named calendars from files


# agent

- randomize proc_id
- break up `execute()` so that start, wait/update are separated
- async requests in agent client
- serve HTTPS
- access control with secret
- agent kills children and removes directory when shut down
- command/API for starting (if necessary) and connecting to agent
- document it


# wait timeout + skip

- max time in waiting state
  - global
  - per job [where?]
- max time (since schedule) per condition
- max run time (since start)

### skip

Let `Condition.skip_runs()` or `Condition.skip()` return a code indicating skip?

Ass a "skipped state?  Or let the condition choose one of the others?

Provide user actions to transition a run to skipped?
