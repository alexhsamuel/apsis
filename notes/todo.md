- Factor loop watchers (`log.critical`) into a common pattern.
- Clean up the restore task.

- To finish `check-job`, we need to remove the program, schedule, action, cond
  aliases from `config.yaml` and move them to a config file specific to the job
  dir.
  


# Idle thoughts

It might be better for the scheduler, scheduled, and waiter loops to be managed
by the Apsis instance, so that it can split workloads (i.e. run some runs before
1scheduling others).  This might also make the components more functional.  They
might not have to reach back and call Apsis methods to transition runs; instead
they would just return instructions and Apsis would do the work.

Maybe we should just bite our tounges and attach the apsis object to each run
instance.  The run objects would become much more active.
