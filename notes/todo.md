# Idle thoughts

It might be better for the scheduler, scheduled, and waiter loops to be managed
by the Apsis instance, so that it can split workloads (i.e. run some runs before
1scheduling others).  This might also make the components more functional.  They
might not have to reach back and call Apsis methods to transition runs; instead
they would just return instructions and Apsis would do the work.

Maybe we should just bite our tounges and attach the apsis object to each run
instance.  The run objects would become much more active.


# Current

- run group needs to go in the RunDB (it can't be recomputed on load because
  the job may no longer be available)

- job subdirectories
  - hierarchical list in web UI
  - search in web UI

- check token in agent protocol

- agent cleanup
  - add endpoint to kill a process
  - add endpoint to forefully shut down
  - automatically clean up abandoned processes after a certain time
  - occasionally poll childen explicitly, to catch silently died processes

- send debug log to file, from config

- handle more runs
  - retire old runs from memory
  - query db for older runs instead of holding them in memory (not possible?)
  - in job view, include time limitation

- remove actions from run summary?

- check out: FastAPI, uvicorn, Starlett

- click on args in run list to add an arg query term
- not (!) in run query
- clean up command line UI
  - implement `apsis runs --times`
  - nicer run list
  - nice job display
- convert `run.times` to log, with schema (timestamp, message, state)
  - retire run/transition message
  - retire times in run?  or hide from UI
- `apsisctl` script 
  - check job *dir*
- configuration
  - provide a way to add functions to jinja2 eval namespace
- refactor runs websocket into event stream
  - contains:
    - run updates
    - output updates
    - job refresh
    - other things?
  - watch runs live in CLUI
  - connection indicator in web UI
- watch jobs for changes
- when a job has changed, cancel and reschedule all future runs?

  - show toast when live log disconnected
- kill button for running run
- factor out Vue API client code into module
  - error handling
- integrate [ansi-to-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi-to-html) for run output
- time range in runs search: design it better
- a good set of demo jobs
- in collapsed run group, show schedule time of original job
- change --host, --port to --bind
- job YAML template
- favicon
- better rerun model
- indicate a run/job as ad hoc
- in runs list, break out args into columns if showing only one job, or if runs have mostly the same params
- prevent the same instance from running more than once... HOW?
- use flex layout for run list selection controls
- performance test with lots of jobs and runs
- store schedule horizon per (job, schedule) ???
  - limit number of runs scheduled per job
- add a --since flag, to control how far back to reschedule when creating
- live elapsed time in runs list
- live output for running jobs in run view
- web UI for showing run, job as JSON
- support multiple outputs per run in API/UI
  - add option to split stdout/stderr
- sanity checker
  - check for unscheduled runs
  - check for late scheduled runs
  - check for orphaned running runs
  - check for runs that ran late
- define the extension mechanism (program, schedule, etc.)
- in RunList, if sorted by time, draw a line at now
- web UI for ad hoc runs
- document API
- tooltip for timestamps with local, UTC, (run-local?), and elapsed times
- factor args out of schedule classes
- web UI reconnects web socket automatically
- indicate in web UI when a job started late
- move schedule time out of times; rename times â†’ timestamps
- have agent attempt to recover orphaned processes

- Change agent so that client-initiated commands are always via SSL.  Implement
  webhook for return notications, like process completion.  See [[ssl.md]].

# agent

- randomize proc_id
