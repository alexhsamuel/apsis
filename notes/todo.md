# Cleanup

- `host_groups` can be subsumed into global definitions; for agent programs,
  define some semantics around how hosts are interpreted (a list? a dict?)

- Remove run_history from `Waiter`.

- Factor loop watchers (`log.critical`) into a common pattern.
- Clean up the restore task.

- To finish `check-job`, we need to remove the program, schedule, action, cond
  aliases from `config.yaml` and move them to a config file specific to the job
  dir.
  

# Template args

Suppose we have a job like this:

```yaml
...
params: [country, date]
schedule:
  type: daily
  args: {county: US}
  calendar: Mon-Fri
  tz: America/New_York
  daytime: 09:00:00
condition:
  type: dependency
  job_id: setup
  args:
    date: "{{ calendar.shift(date, -1) }}"
```

How does `calendar` get into the template args for the condition? 
Bear in mind that,
- There may be multiple schedules, with different calendars.
- A run may be started directly rather than from any schedule at all.

Choices:

1. Add `calendar` (and `tz`, and whatever else relevant) from the schedule to
   the template args used elsewhere in the run.
   
   This means that a run cannot be created outside of a schedule, or at least
   that the missing `calendar` needs to be supplied as a (non-param!) arg.
   
2. Provide a mechanism to expand template args from normal args.  In this case,
   something like this:
   
   ```yaml
   country:
     US:
       tz: America/New_York
       calendar: Mon-Fri
   ```
   
   When template-expanding, we first expand instance args through thsi to arrive
   at a larger set of template args.

   These could be local to a single job, or global to a whole job dir?

Choice 2 is better because is keeps closer to the notion that jobs are
parametrized fully by their params, and not by a bunch of extra args inserted as
a side effect of the schedule.


# Idle thoughts

It might be better for the scheduler, scheduled, and waiter loops to be managed
by the Apsis instance, so that it can split workloads (i.e. run some runs before
1scheduling others).  This might also make the components more functional.  They
might not have to reach back and call Apsis methods to transition runs; instead
they would just return instructions and Apsis would do the work.

Maybe we should just bite our tounges and attach the apsis object to each run
instance.  The run objects would become much more active.
