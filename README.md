Apsis is a task scheduler.  Its main responsibility is to run tasks at specific
times, including recurring tasks.  It also tracks running tasks, and the state
of completed tasks.  It supports simple and complex schedules, such as once an
hour, or 4:00 PM US/Eastern on the day before every US holiday.
